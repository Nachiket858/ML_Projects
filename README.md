# ML Projects Repository 🚀

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects** repository! 🎉 This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that I've worked on, showcasing a variety of techniques and algorithms aimed at solving real-world problems. Each project demonstrates different aspects of machine learning, from predictive models to classification tasks, with a focus on practical applications.

## 🧑‍💻 Project List

### 1. **FWI Prediction** 🔥🌲

- **Description**: This project focuses on predicting the **Fire Weather Index (FWI)**, a vital metric used to assess the risk of wildfires. The model uses environmental and weather-related data to predict the likelihood of fire outbreaks, empowering authorities to take preventive actions and minimize fire damage. 🌍💡
